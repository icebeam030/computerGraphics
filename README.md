# computerGraphics
A WebGL animation and visualisation project using Three.js

## Running the app
### Use Chrome
- Best compatibility
- Follow these [instructions](https://threejs.org/docs/#manual/en/introduction/How-to-run-things-locally) to allow local resource loading
- After that, go to your local server or open [index.html](./index.html)
### Use Firefox
- No additional settings, open [index.html](./index.html) directly
- But there are some CSS compatibility issues that cause minor visual distractions

## Using the app
- Use the control panel to adjust parameters
- Click on 'MusicVisualiser' in the control panel to open the [music visualiser](./audioVisualiser.html) (an inspiration and modification of tariqksoliman's [Vissonance](https://github.com/tariqksoliman/Vissonance) project)
- Drag and scroll your mouse for camera control
